You are implementing a new primary dashboard page called “Today’s Game Plan”.

GOAL:
Replace the existing Dashboard landing experience with a single action-oriented screen that tells the gig worker exactly what to do next to stay on track and get paid.

DO NOT remove any existing pages or routes.
This is a NEW dashboard view that becomes the default landing page after login.

------------------------------------------------
ROUTE & STRUCTURE
------------------------------------------------
Route: /dashboard (default after login)

Page Title: “Today’s Game Plan”
Subtitle: “Do these things to stay on track and get paid”

Use existing layout, sidebar, top navigation, and styling system.
Do NOT introduce new colors or typography systems.

------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1: DO THIS FIRST (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
------------------------------------------------
Show a single high-priority task if one exists.

Priority order:
1. Overdue invoice not sent
2. Invoice sent but overdue for payment
3. Upcoming job within 24 hours without reminder sent
4. Lead with no response after 24 hours

Display format:
- Card with red or orange accent border
- Icon based on task type (invoice, job, message)

Example content:
“Send invoice to Michael Chen”
“$450 • Due today”
Primary CTA button:
- “Send Invoice”
- “Send Reminder”
- “Follow Up”

If NO priority items exist:
Display a green success state:
“✅ You’re all caught up”

------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2: UP NEXT (MAX 3 ITEMS)
------------------------------------------------
Show the next 3 actionable items in priority order.

Each item includes:
- Icon
- Short sentence (plain language)
- One primary action button

Examples:
- “Job with Sarah — Tomorrow at 10:00 AM” → [View Job]
- “Client hasn’t replied — Follow up?” → [Send Message]
- “Invoice not sent — $100” → [Send Invoice]

Do NOT show more than 3 items.

------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3: TODAY AT A GLANCE
------------------------------------------------
Simple stat row (no charts):

- Jobs today
- Money collected today
- Money waiting
- Messages to send

Use existing stat card components.
Keep text large and readable.

------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4: QUICK ACTIONS
------------------------------------------------
Large, thumb-friendly buttons (2x2 grid on desktop, stacked on mobile):

- “Add a Job” → /jobs/new
- “Ask for Payment” → /invoices/new
- “Message a Client” → /reminders/new
- “Talk It In” → /ai-tools/voice-notes

Reuse existing button components.

------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5: DONE RECENTLY (OPTIONAL)
------------------------------------------------
Show last 3 completed actions:
- Invoice paid
- Reminder sent
- Job completed

This section is low-contrast and visually quiet.

------------------------------------------------
DATA SOURCES & LOGIC
------------------------------------------------
Use existing tables/models:
- jobs
- invoices
- reminders
- leads

Create a derived “nextActions” selector that:
- Evaluates urgency
- Returns ordered actionable items
- Limits results to 1 (priority) + 3 (up next)

Do NOT change database schemas.

------------------------------------------------
LABEL LANGUAGE (IMPORTANT)
------------------------------------------------
Use gig-worker language ONLY:
- “Get Paid” instead of Invoices
- “Ask for Payment” instead of Create Invoice
- “New Requests” instead of Leads
- “Client Messages” instead of Reminders

------------------------------------------------
MOBILE BEHAVIOR
------------------------------------------------
- Stack sections vertically
- Keep primary CTA visible without scrolling
- Avoid tables on this screen

------------------------------------------------
FINAL CHECKS
------------------------------------------------
- Page loads in under 1 second
- No breaking changes to existing routes
- Dashboard immediately communicates “what should I do now?”

Implement cleanly and conservatively.
