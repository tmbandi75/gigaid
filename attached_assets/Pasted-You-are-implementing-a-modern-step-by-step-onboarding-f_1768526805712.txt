You are implementing a modern, step-by-step onboarding flow for GigAid.

GOAL:
Get a new user to their first real “win” (job + payment request) in under 3 minutes,
then celebrate success and send them to the main dashboard.

DO NOT show a traditional product tour.
DO NOT explain features upfront.
This onboarding must feel like “doing real work,” not setup.

------------------------------------------------
ENTRY POINT
------------------------------------------------
Trigger onboarding immediately after first successful signup/login.

If user has completed onboarding before, skip entirely.

------------------------------------------------
ONBOARDING STRUCTURE
------------------------------------------------
Use a full-screen modal or stepper overlay.
Show progress indicator: Step X of 4
Allow Back, but discourage skipping.

Modern, clean, calm tone.
No jargon.

------------------------------------------------
STEP 1 — WHAT KIND OF WORK DO YOU DO?
------------------------------------------------
Title:
“Let’s get you ready to get paid”

Subtitle:
“What kind of work do you usually do?”

Selectable options (large cards with icons):
- Plumbing
- Electrical
- Cleaning
- Handyman
- Landscaping
- Other

Save selection to user profile as primaryServiceType.

Primary CTA:
[ Continue ]

------------------------------------------------
STEP 2 — ADD A REAL JOB (PRE-FILLED)
------------------------------------------------
Title:
“Let’s add a job”

Subtitle:
“This can be a past job or one coming up — we’ll help.”

Show a simplified job form with smart defaults:
- Job Title (auto-filled based on service type)
- Date (default: today)
- Time (optional)
- Price (optional, clearly optional)

No empty state.
Fields should already contain suggested values.

Primary CTA:
[ Add Job ]

------------------------------------------------
STEP 3 — WANT TO GET PAID?
------------------------------------------------
After job creation, immediately show this step.

Title:
“Want to get paid for this job?”

Subtitle:
“We’ll send a simple payment request to your client.”

Show:
- Amount (pre-filled if entered)
- Message (AI-generated, editable)
- Delivery method suggestion (SMS or Email)

Primary CTA:
[ Send Payment Request ]

Secondary CTA:
[ I’ll do this later ]

If sent successfully:
- Mark onboarding as ACTIVATED
- Record time-to-first-invoice metric

------------------------------------------------
STEP 4 — YOU’RE ALL SET 🎉
------------------------------------------------
Trigger full-screen celebration.

🎊 CONFETTI ANIMATION (required)
🎉 Subtle sound effect (optional)

Title:
“Nice work!”

Encouraging message examples (pick one randomly):
- “You’re officially set up. Let’s keep the momentum going.”
- “That’s how easy it is. We’ll help you stay on track.”
- “You’re ready. We’ll tell you what to do next.”

------------------------------------------------
APP DOWNLOAD PROMPT (IMPORTANT)
------------------------------------------------
Below the message, show two large buttons:

📱 “Get the GigAid App”
- Button 1: Download on the App Store
- Button 2: Get it on Google Play

Text below buttons:
“Install the app so you don’t miss jobs, payments, or reminders.”

Buttons should:
- Open App Store / Google Play if links are available
- Otherwise show “Coming soon” gracefully

------------------------------------------------
FINAL CTA
------------------------------------------------
Primary CTA:
[ Go to Dashboard ]

Route user to:
 /dashboard (Today’s Game Plan)

Set onboardingCompleted = true

------------------------------------------------
DESIGN & UX NOTES
------------------------------------------------
- No walls of text
- Large buttons
- Plain language only
- Mobile-first spacing
- Confetti should feel celebratory, not childish

------------------------------------------------
FINAL CHECKS
------------------------------------------------
- Onboarding completes in under 3 minutes
- User reaches dashboard with at least one job created
- Payment request encouraged but not forced
- App download is clearly promoted before dashboard

Implement cleanly and conservatively.
