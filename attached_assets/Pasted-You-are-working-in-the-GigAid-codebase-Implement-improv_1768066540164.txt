You are working in the GigAid codebase. Implement improvements to the onboarding checklist UX + copy, re-order the steps for faster time-to-value, and add a celebratory confetti animation when onboarding is completed.

GOALS (must all be met)
1) Re-order checklist steps to emphasize immediate value:
   - Step 1: Share Booking Link
   - Step 2: Add a Service
   - Step 3: Set Your Hours (Availability)
   - Step 4: Turn on Reminders
2) Rename the checklist header from “Getting Started” to: “Get Your First Job Booked”
3) Improve microcopy to be outcome-focused and plainspoken for non-technical gig workers (see COPY section below).
4) Completion experience:
   - When all 4 steps are complete, show a “You’re ready to book jobs 🎉” success state
   - Provide a primary CTA button: “Copy Booking Link”
   - Trigger a short confetti celebration (1–2 seconds) ONCE when the user completes onboarding (not every time they open the dashboard).
   - Persist a flag so confetti doesn’t replay after completion unless onboarding is reset.
5) Keep the existing structure and routes where possible. DO NOT refactor unrelated code. Make the smallest safe changes.
6) Add basic analytics events (if analytics already exists) for:
   - onboarding_checklist_viewed
   - onboarding_step_clicked (step_key)
   - onboarding_step_completed (step_key)
   - onboarding_completed
   - onboarding_copy_booking_link_clicked

COPY (use exactly or very close)
- Checklist title: “Get Your First Job Booked”
- Step 1 title: “Share Your Booking Link”
  Step 1 subtitle: “Send this to clients to book and pay you”
  CTA: “Get Link”
- Step 2 title: “Add a Service”
  Step 2 subtitle: “What do you usually get hired to do?”
  CTA: “Add Service”
- Step 3 title: “Set Your Hours”
  Step 3 subtitle: “When can clients book you?”
  CTA: “Set Hours”
- Step 4 title: “Turn on Reminders”
  Step 4 subtitle: “Reduce no-shows automatically”
  CTA: “Enable”
- Completion title: “You’re ready to book jobs 🎉”
  Completion subtitle: “Send your booking link to your next customer and get paid faster.”
  Primary CTA: “Copy Booking Link”
  Secondary: “Dismiss”

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
A) Identify existing onboarding checklist component(s)
   - Search for “Getting Started”, “checklist”, “setup”, “progress”, or the current step definitions.
   - Locate where step completion is calculated (e.g., based on existence of service, availability, booking link config, reminder).
B) Rebuild step definitions as a typed array:
   - key: 'share_booking_link' | 'add_service' | 'set_availability' | 'enable_reminders'
   - title, subtitle, ctaLabel
   - actionRoute (existing route)
   - isComplete() selector based on existing state/data
C) Re-order by array order (Step 1 should always be booking link).
D) Dashboard UI:
   - Use existing progress bar, checkmarks, and action buttons.
   - Ensure each step has a single CTA button that navigates to existing Settings/Reminders screens.
   - When returning, the step should auto-check if requirements are met.
E) Confetti:
   - Add a lightweight confetti library such as `canvas-confetti` (preferred) or `react-confetti`.
   - Trigger confetti ONLY at the moment onboarding becomes complete (transition from incomplete -> complete).
   - Duration ~1200–1800ms.
   - Don’t block the UI; run asynchronously.
   - Add persistence:
     - store `onboarding_completed_at` and `onboarding_confetti_shown=true` in localStorage (or existing user profile preferences table if available).
     - If you already have a user settings/preferences table, prefer storing server-side; otherwise use localStorage.
   - Add a “Reset onboarding” dev-only toggle if one already exists; otherwise do not add.
F) “Copy Booking Link” CTA:
   - Use the existing booking link value (public booking URL).
   - Copy to clipboard and show a toast “Link copied”.
   - If booking link isn’t available, fallback to navigating the user to the Booking Link screen.
G) Tests/QA (light):
   - Verify checklist appears for new users.
   - Verify step order is correct.
   - Verify completion state appears after all 4 are complete.
   - Verify confetti triggers once, not repeatedly on refresh.
   - Verify events fire (only if analytics exists; otherwise add TODO stubs, do not add a full analytics framework).

CONSTRAINTS
- No breaking changes.
- No broad refactors.
- Preserve existing routes and data model.
- If you must add a dependency, update package.json and lockfile accordingly.

DELIVERABLES
1) Updated checklist UI with new title, step order, and copy.
2) Completion state with “Copy Booking Link”.
3) Confetti celebration on first completion with persistence guard.
4) Minimal code diff and brief notes in comments where you made changes.

Proceed by:
1) Locating the checklist code and current step logic
2) Implementing the new step array + copy
3) Adding completion detection + confetti
4) Adding the copy-link CTA
5) Verifying no repeated confetti and no regressions
