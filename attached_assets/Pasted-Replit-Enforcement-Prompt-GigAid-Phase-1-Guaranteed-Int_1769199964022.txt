Replit Enforcement Prompt — GigAid
Phase 1 Guaranteed-Intent Booking + Rare AI Interventions
🔒 SYSTEM ROLE

You are implementing GigAid’s booking protection and intervention system.

Your primary objective is reducing no-shows, ghosting, and wasted time for solo service providers without increasing cognitive load.

If a design choice adds configuration, dashboards, scores, or frequent messages — reject it.

🧠 CORE PRODUCT PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

GigAid decides by default

Users should not manage rules

AI may change behavior but must not add decisions

Silence is the default

If users notice the AI often, the system is broken

=========================
PHASE 1 — GUARANTEED-INTENT BOOKING (MVP)
=========================
🎯 Goal

Automatically enforce deposits and commitment rules to drastically reduce no-shows with near-zero setup.

✅ Phase 1 Behavior (Rules-Based, No ML)
Booking Risk Conditions (Hardcoded v1)

A booking is considered higher risk if ANY are true:

Client is first-time

Booking is within 24 hours

Booking price ≥ configurable default (e.g. $100)

Client has ≥1 prior cancellation or no-show

Enforcement Actions

If booking is higher risk:

Require deposit (default % set by system)

Lock booking time upon payment

Display cancellation policy before confirmation

Mark booking internally as protected = true

If not higher risk:

Allow booking without deposit

Still mark as protected = false

Worker UX (Critical Constraint)

One toggle only:
“Protect me from no-shows” → ON by default

No per-booking controls

No explanations of rules

No deposit configuration in Phase 1

Client UX

Clear copy:

“This time is reserved once payment is confirmed.”

One intentional friction point (choose ONE):

Phone verification OR

Explicit acknowledgment checkbox

Data Stored (Minimal)

Only store:

client_id

is_first_time_client (boolean)

booking_lead_time

booking_price

deposit_applied (boolean)

cancellation_count

No scores. No confidence levels.

=========================
PHASE 2 (LIMITED) — MOMENT-OF-TRUTH INTERVENTIONS
=========================
🎯 Purpose

AI may speak rarely when silence would likely cost the worker time or money.

AI is not allowed to educate, coach, or narrate its thinking.

🚨 Hard Limits (ENFORCE STRICTLY)

Max 1 AI intervention per user per calendar day

Only trigger when statistically meaningful

No numbers, percentages, or confidence scores

Plain language only

If no strong signal → say nothing

✅ Allowed Intervention Categories (ONLY THESE 3)
1️⃣ Booking Risk Adjustment (Silent by Default)

AI may silently adjust:

Deposit amount

Prepay vs deposit

Booking mode (instant vs request)

User is not notified unless intervention is critical.

2️⃣ Explicit Intervention — Risk Protection

Trigger only if:

Client has repeated cancel behavior

Pattern is consistent (not single event)

Example copy (exact tone):

“This client often cancels. A deposit is now required.”

Rules:

One sentence

No blame

No explanation

3️⃣ Explicit Intervention — Revenue or Conversion Risk

Trigger only if:

Delay or pricing is likely to cost income

Allowed examples:

“This lead converts best if replied to soon.”

“You may be underpricing this service in this area.”

Rules:

No urgency emojis

No numbers

No follow-up messages

❌ Explicitly Disallowed

Dashboards

Risk scores

“Why this happened” explanations

AI configuration panels

Frequent nudges

Any language that sounds like analytics or metrics

If an intervention feels like advice instead of protection — remove it.

🧪 Intervention Gate Logic (Pseudo)

Trigger ONLY if ALL are true:

Pattern observed ≥ defined threshold

Impact is material (time or money loss likely)

User has not received an AI message today

Message can be said in one sentence

Otherwise → do nothing.

🧠 Internal Mantra (Do Not Surface)

“If it’s on the GigAid calendar, it should be worth the worker’s time.”

✅ Success Criteria

Reduced no-shows

Fewer unpaid jobs

Workers trust bookings without thinking

AI messages feel rare, calm, and helpful

If users ever say:

“I keep getting AI messages”

You failed.

🚫 Implementation Warning

Do NOT:

Ask the user questions

Add configuration

Expose AI reasoning

Surface partial signals

Default to silence.
