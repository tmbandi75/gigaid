Polish GigAid’s UX to maximize clarity, urgency, and emotional guidance while keeping:

All existing features

All existing routes

All existing data models

Zero breaking changes

This is a presentation-layer refinement only.

🧠 Guiding Principles (LOCKED)

User should know what to do next in ≤3 seconds

Money and urgency always win visual priority

No new flows, no removals

No backend changes

No AI hype language

1️⃣ Add Explicit Priority Badges (UI-Only)
Implement small, consistent priority badges across:

Leads

Jobs

Invoices

Today’s Game Plan items

Badge Types (max 1 per item):

🔥 High Priority (hot lead, likely conversion)

⚠️ At Risk (no reply, overdue, stalled)

⏰ Time Sensitive (upcoming job, deadline)

💰 Payment Risk (invoice overdue)

Rules:

Badge = icon + short label

Use existing color system:

Red → Payment / critical

Orange → Time / urgency

Green → positive / progressing

Placement:

Right-aligned on list cards

Below title on primary cards

⚠️ Do NOT show scores, percentages, or probabilities.

2️⃣ Replace Lead Percentages With Heat Labels (UI Mapping Only)
On Leads screen:

Replace any visible % (e.g. “75%”) with:

🔥 Hot

🟡 Warm

❄️ Cold

Mapping logic (frontend only):

≥70% → Hot

40–69% → Warm

<40% → Cold

Backend values remain unchanged.

3️⃣ Deduplicate “What To Do Next” Suggestions
Update Today’s Game Plan logic:

Do NOT show duplicate suggestions

If multiple items share the same action:

Group them into a single card

Example:

“2 jobs need status updates”

CTA: Update Now

4️⃣ Strengthen Emotional Copy in Idle States

When metrics show:

0 jobs today

$0 collected today

No urgent actions

Add supportive, action-oriented copy (non-alarmist).

Example:

“Quiet day — great time to follow up or send invoices.”

This is copy-only. No new logic.

5️⃣ Tighten CTA Hierarchy (No Layout Changes)

Ensure:

Each card has one primary CTA

Secondary actions are de-emphasized (icon-only or text link)

No screen presents two competing primary buttons

Do NOT add new buttons.

6️⃣ Minor Visual Consistency Pass
Enforce consistency:

Status chips:

Same colors across Leads / Jobs / Invoices

Icons:

Same icon meaning everywhere (clock = time, $ = money)

Spacing:

Reduce vertical padding on stacked cards by ~10% for scan speed

Do NOT change typography scale.

7️⃣ Guardrails (DO NOT VIOLATE)

🚫 Do NOT:

Rename routes

Change navigation

Add onboarding steps

Add modals or popups

Introduce settings or toggles

Modify backend schemas or APIs

✅ This pass must be:

Safe to deploy

Reversible

Testable via UI only

🧪 Acceptance Criteria (Must Pass All)

User can identify top priority action in ≤3 seconds

Overdue money is visually unmistakable

No duplicate “What To Do Next” cards appear

Leads communicate “hot vs cold” instantly

App feels calmer, not louder

📦 Expected Output

Priority badges visible across key lists

Heat-based lead labels (Hot / Warm / Cold)

Cleaner Today’s Game Plan

Improved empty / idle state tone

No regressions

END PROMPT
