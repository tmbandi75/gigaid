Replit Prompt: Add Source Link + Update Lead Status Flow (MVP-Safe)

Context

GigAid manages leads from external marketplaces (Craigslist, Facebook, etc.)
The actual conversations happen outside the app.

We must:

Track lead progress honestly

Give users a fast way to return to the original conversation

Avoid scraping, syncing, or pretending we control external platforms

🎯 Goals

Add a Source Link to Leads

Make Source Link a first-class action in the Lead UI

Integrate Source Link into the Lead status flow

Keep all behavior manual, honest, and MVP-safe

1️⃣ Schema Update (Additive Only)

Extend the existing leads table with:

source_type (string, optional)

Examples: craigslist, facebook, thumbtack, instagram

source_url (text, optional)

Full URL to original post or conversation thread

response_sent_at (timestamp, nullable)

Set when user copies/sends a reply externally

Do not remove or rename any existing fields.

2️⃣ Lead Status Enum (No New States)

Use the existing Lead statuses:

new

response_sent

engaged

price_confirmed

cold

lost

Do NOT add delivery/read states.

3️⃣ Source Link Behavior Rules
Visibility

If source_url exists:

Show a primary button: “Open original post”

Button must:

Open link in a new tab/window

Be visible in all non-terminal states (lost optional but allowed)

Labeling

Use human language only:

“Open original post”

“Return to conversation”

Do NOT label it:

“External URL”

“Source field”

“Marketplace link”

4️⃣ Status Transitions (Updated Logic)
NEW → RESPONSE SENT

When user copies a response:

Set status to response_sent

Set response_sent_at = now()

Do NOT assume delivery or reply

RESPONSE SENT → 24-Hour Check-In

After 24 hours from response_sent_at, show a passive prompt:

Prompt text

“Did they reply?”

Actions

“Yes, they replied” → status = engaged

“Not yet” → keep status, offer Source Link button

“No response” → status = cold

Never auto-send messages.

COLD State Behavior

In cold state:

Hide lead from default active list

Keep it accessible via filters

Always allow:

Open original post

Manual re-engagement

Do NOT block further actions.

ENGAGED → PRICE CONFIRMED

Unchanged from current logic.

Source Link remains visible.

5️⃣ UI / UX Constraints (Critical)

Source Link must be one tap away

No scraping

No inbox mirroring

No login requests for external platforms

No automated follow-ups

GigAid is a sidecar, not a bridge.

6️⃣ Explicit Non-Goals (Do NOT Implement)

❌ Detect replies automatically

❌ Scrape Craigslist or Facebook

❌ Sync messages

❌ Guess engagement status

❌ Hide Source Link when lead is cold

7️⃣ Success Criteria

User always knows where the lead came from

User can always return to the original conversation

Lead status flow remains honest and simple

No false assumptions about external platforms

MVP remains stable and compliant

Proceed with this implementation exactly as described.
