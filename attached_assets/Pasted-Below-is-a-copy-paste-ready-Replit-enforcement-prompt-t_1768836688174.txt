Below is a **copy-paste-ready Replit enforcement prompt** that implements **A) Confidence Calibration** and **B) the Hidden Learning Feedback Loop** exactly as specified — **without weakening restraint, without adding UI noise, and without exposing AI mechanics to users**.

This is written to *layer cleanly on top of* your existing **Next Best Action** automation.

## 🔧 REPLIT ENFORCEMENT PROMPT

**Feature Name:** `ConfidenceCalibrationAndLearning_v1`

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Improve trust and accuracy of AI-assisted monetization by:

1. Allowing **quiet correction** when estimates are wrong
2. Learning from user overrides **silently and continuously**

This must:

* Preserve CTA dominance
* Avoid new buttons or menus
* Avoid explaining AI to the user
* Avoid interrupting flow

---

# A️⃣ CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION (INLINE, QUIET)

## UI REQUIREMENTS

### CONTEXT

This applies **only** inside the existing **“Send & Get Paid”** card.

---

### INLINE EDIT AFFORDANCE (MANDATORY)

* The **amount field must be editable by tap**
* It must **not look like a button**
* It must **not introduce a secondary CTA**

#### Behavior:

* Amount appears as plain text by default
* On tap → transforms into inline numeric input
* Cursor auto-focuses
* On blur or enter → value locks back into text state

#### Visual rules:

* No border animation
* No color change on CTA
* No tooltip
* No helper copy

CTA **“Send & Get Paid”** must remain:

* Visually dominant
* Unchanged in color, size, or position

---

### HARD CONSTRAINTS

* ❌ No “Edit” label
* ❌ No pencil icon
* ❌ No confirmation modal
* ❌ No additional buttons
* ❌ No “AI suggested” text

---

### ACCEPTABLE USER EXPERIENCE

> User taps the amount.
> Changes it.
> Taps Send.
> Done.

---

# B️⃣ LEARNING FEEDBACK LOOP (INVISIBLE)

## TRACKING RULES (INTERNAL ONLY)

Whenever the user **modifies** any AI-suggested value or action, log an override event.

### OVERRIDE EVENTS TO TRACK

* Amount changed
* CTA ignored / dismissed
* CTA delayed beyond expiration
* Different action taken than recommended
* Manual invoice sent instead of suggested flow

---

### REQUIRED EVENT SCHEMA

```json
{
  "event_type": "ai_override",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "entity_type": "lead | job | invoice",
  "entity_id": "uuid",
  "original_suggestion": {
    "action": "string",
    "amount": number,
    "timing": "timestamp"
  },
  "user_override": {
    "action": "string",
    "amount": number | null,
    "delay_seconds": number
  },
  "context_signals": {
    "confidence_score": number,
    "intent_signals": ["string"],
    "time_of_day": "string",
    "job_type": "string"
  },
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601"
}
```

⚠️ **Do NOT surface this to the user. Ever.**

---

## MODEL FEEDBACK RULES

Use override data to:

1. Adjust **amount estimation ranges**
2. Adjust **confidence thresholds** for triggering recommendations
3. Adjust **timing sensitivity** (how quickly to act next time)

### DO NOT:

* Retrain models in real time
* Change UI behavior immediately
* Surface learning acknowledgements

This learning must be:

* Asynchronous
* Aggregated
* Slow-moving
* Invisible

---

## 🧘 RESTRAINT SAFEGUARDS (CRITICAL)

* If override rate exceeds threshold → **reduce automation frequency**
* Never increase nudges based on overrides
* Overrides signal **uncertainty**, not failure

When in doubt:

> Do less, not more.

---

## 🧠 PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

* Users are **correcting**, not “fixing AI”
* Silence = confidence
* One action at a time
* The system adapts quietly in the background

---

## ✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This implementation is correct only if:

* Users can adjust amounts **without thinking**
* CTA dominance is unchanged
* No user sees new controls or explanations
* Override data improves estimates over time
* No additional notifications are introduced

---

## ❌ EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE

* User-facing confidence scores
* “Was this helpful?” prompts
* AI explanation panels
* Settings or toggles
* Learning dashboards

---

## 🧩 RESULT

GigAid becomes:

* More accurate
* More trusted
* Less visible
* More indispensable
