# 🚀 Project: Gig Aid – AI-Enhanced Client Booking Page
Implement AI features on the public booking page to reduce friction and increase conversion for gig clients.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Frontend: React (Vite + Tailwind)
- Backend: Supabase (Postgres for jobs, services, clients)
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude Sonnet for text generation
- Optional: Stripe (for price estimator logic)

---

## 📄 Booking Page Components (Existing)
This is a **public booking link** used by clients to:
- View gig worker profile and services
- Select service
- Pick date/time
- Add job notes
- Confirm booking

---

## ✨ AI Feature 1: Smart Service Recommender
### Goal:
Suggest the best-matching service when a client types a need (e.g., “I need help with my leaking sink”)

### UI:
- Input field: “Not sure what to book? Describe your issue.”
- Below it: AI-generated suggestions with CTA: “Book this”

### API Endpoint: `/api/ai/recommendService`
- Input: `{ userInput: string, providerId: string }`
- Output: `{ suggestedServiceId, label, description, duration, price }`

Use GPT to:
- Match input to provider’s existing services (from Supabase)
- Return top 1–2 matches

---

## ✨ AI Feature 2: Job Notes Auto-Complete
### Goal:
Help clients describe the job by autocompleting special instructions or common job notes

### UI:
- Field: “Special Notes”
- As user types, show ghost text or dropdown suggestion
- Example: User types “leaking…” → AI suggests full sentence

### API Endpoint: `/api/ai/notesAutocomplete`
- Input: `{ partialText: string, serviceName?: string }`
- Output: `{ suggestion: string }`

Trigger suggestion on 3+ words typed

---

## ✨ AI Feature 3: FAQ Assistant (Context-Aware)
### Goal:
Answer common client questions directly on the page without support requests

### UI:
- Small button: “❓ Questions?”
- Opens popup with:
  - Input field: “Ask a question…”
  - Suggested FAQs (e.g., "What’s your cancellation policy?")

### API Endpoint: `/api/ai/faqAssistant`
- Input: `{ question: string, serviceId?: string, providerName?: string }`
- Output: `{ answer: string }`

Use GPT with prompt tuned to FAQs, include fallback answers if unknown

---

## ✨ (Optional) AI Feature 4: Dynamic Price Estimator
### Goal:
Estimate price based on job description if no fixed-price service applies

### UI:
- Input field: “What do you need help with?”
- Output: “Estimated cost: $125 – based on local rates and job size”

### API Endpoint: `/api/ai/priceEstimator`
- Input: `{ description: string, zipCode?: string, baseRates: Service[] }`
- Output: `{ estimateRange: string }`

---

## 📦 Supabase Tables (simplified)
- `services`: id, providerId, name, description, price, duration
- `clients`: id, name, phone, email
- `jobs`: id, serviceId, clientId, notes, date, time, createdAt

---

## ✅ Requirements
- All AI-generated suggestions must be editable
- Must fallback to manual entry if API fails
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use loading states + error handling
- AI APIs must respond < 2s or fallback
- DO NOT block booking flow with AI delays

---

## 🔚 Deliverables
- `<SmartServiceRecommender />` component with API integration
- `<JobNotesAutocomplete />` input enhancer
- `<FAQAssistant />` mini popup widget
- (Optional) `<PriceEstimator />` panel

Start with Smart Service Recommender and Autocomplete first — those drive most value in MVP.
