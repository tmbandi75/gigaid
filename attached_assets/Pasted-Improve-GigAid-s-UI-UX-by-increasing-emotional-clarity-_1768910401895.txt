Improve GigAid’s UI/UX by increasing emotional clarity, decision guidance, and AI outcome visibility without removing or restructuring existing features.

This is a UX enhancement pass, not a visual redesign.

🧠 Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

Reduce thinking, increase reacting

Prioritize urgency and money

AI speaks in outcomes, not features

One dominant action per screen

No breaking changes to existing flows

✅ REQUIRED CHANGES
1️⃣ Add Universal Priority Signals (HIGH PRIORITY)
Implement a standardized Priority System across:

Leads

Jobs

Invoices

Messages

Priority Levels:

🔥 High Priority (conversion/payment likely)

⚠️ At Risk (no response, overdue, stalled)

⏰ Time Sensitive (upcoming job / deadline)

💰 Payment Risk (invoice overdue)

Rules:

Priority badges appear as small icon + color chip

Use consistent colors:

Red → Payment / critical

Orange → Time-sensitive

Green → Positive / progressing

Priority is AI-inferred, but overrideable later (do not build override UI yet)

Do NOT show percentages or confidence numbers.

2️⃣ Strengthen “Today’s Game Plan” as the Emotional Core
Update “Today’s Game Plan” logic:

Always show 1 primary action at the top (“DO THIS FIRST”)

Follow with max 3 secondary actions

Each item must:

Clearly state why it matters

Contain a single CTA (no choice)

Example:

“Payment overdue from Lisa Wang — $350 — 13 days”
CTA: Send Reminder

If no urgent items exist:

Show a positive reinforcement state:

“You’re on track today. Want to get ahead?”

3️⃣ Rename AI Tools to Outcome-Based Language
Update labels / subtitles ONLY (do not change routes or logic):
Current Label	New Label
AI Assistant	Business Co-Pilot
Booking Insights	Get More Bookings
Smart Tags	Know Who’s Serious
Growth Tips	Grow My Business
Smart Suggestions	What To Do Next

Subtitles must explicitly state what the user gets, not how it works.

Example:

“AI analytics on your bookings”
→
“See what’s working and where you’re losing jobs”

4️⃣ Reduce “Create” Choice Overload
Implement ONE dominant creation action per screen:

Add a context-aware primary CTA:

Jobs → “Add New Job”

Requests → “Add New Lead”

Plan → “What do you want to do?”

Secondary creation options:

Keep Text to Job

Keep Voice Notes

Keep Quick Capture

But:

Move them under a secondary menu or expandable section

Do NOT remove features

No floating action button yet — use existing layout.

5️⃣ Standardize Status Chips (Consistency Pass)
Enforce consistency rules:

Max 5 statuses per object type

Status colors must be reused globally

Status language must be verb-based (e.g., “Awaiting Reply”, not “Contacted”)

Do NOT rename backend enums yet — UI-only mapping.

6️⃣ Progressive Disclosure for Advanced Tools
Hide the following tools until at least ONE is true:

First job completed

First invoice sent

First payment collected

Tools to gate:

Advanced AI insights

Growth analytics

Referral generator

When hidden:

Show locked state with copy:

“Unlocks after your first paid job”

7️⃣ No UI Regression Rules

Do NOT remove any existing feature

Do NOT change navigation structure

Do NOT introduce new required user steps

Do NOT add onboarding modals

Do NOT add settings toggles

All changes must be:

Incremental

Reversible

UI-layer only

🧪 Acceptance Criteria

The update is successful if:

A user can open the app and know what to do next within 3 seconds

No screen shows more than one dominant action

AI features clearly communicate business outcomes

Urgency and money are visually obvious

🚫 Explicitly Out of Scope

Visual redesign

Animation changes

Backend refactors

Pricing changes

Feature removals

✅ Deliverables

Updated UI labels and chips

Priority indicators across lists

Improved “Today’s Game Plan” logic

Reduced creation choice overload

Gated advanced tools with clear unlock messaging
