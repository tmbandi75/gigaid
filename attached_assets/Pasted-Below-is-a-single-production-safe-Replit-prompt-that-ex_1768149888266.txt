Below is a **single, production-safe Replit prompt** that **extends your existing Owner View** with:

1. **Paid-plan gating**
2. **Weekly email summaries**

This is written to be **additive only**, aligned with your GigAid model, and safe for an early-stage product (no refactors, no breaking flows).

## ✅ Replit Prompt: Paid Owner View + Weekly Summary Emails

**Context**

GigAid is a mobile-first app for gig workers.
The **Owner View** is a desktop-first, read-only business snapshot.

We now want to:

* Make Owner View a **paid-plan feature**
* Add **weekly email summaries** that reinforce value and retention

This must be:

* Lightweight
* Non-invasive
* Backward-compatible
* Easy to disable/extend later

---

## 🎯 Goals

1. Restrict `/owner` access to paid users only
2. Show a friendly upgrade screen for free users
3. Send a **weekly business summary email** to paid users
4. Reuse existing data (jobs, invoices, leads)
5. Avoid complex billing logic or heavy analytics

---

## 1️⃣ Paid Plan Lock (Owner View)

### Assumptions

* There is an existing `users` or `accounts` table with:

  * `plan` or `subscription_tier`
  * OR a boolean like `is_paid`
* If none exists, add a **single field**:

  * `plan: 'free' | 'pro' | 'business'`

Do NOT integrate billing logic here — only read plan status.

---

### Access Rules for `/owner`

* If user is:

  * `plan = free` → deny access
  * `plan != free` → allow access

---

### Free User Experience (important)

If a free user visits `/owner`:

Show an **Upgrade Gate Screen**, not an error.

**Content**

* Title: “Owner View is a Pro Feature”
* Bullet points:

  * See weekly & monthly revenue
  * Track unpaid invoices
  * Know what jobs are coming up
* CTA:

  * “Upgrade to Pro”
* Secondary CTA:

  * “Back to Jobs”

No dark patterns. No hard lockout.

---

### Paid User Experience

* Direct access to Owner View
* No upsell banners
* No friction

---

## 2️⃣ Weekly Email Summary (Paid Users Only)

### Purpose

Reinforce:

> “GigAid helps me make and track money.”

This is **retention**, not marketing.

---

### Schedule

* Send **once per week**
* Default: **Monday at 8am local time**
* Can be implemented via:

  * background job
  * cron
  * scheduled function (depending on stack)

---

### Recipients

* Only users with:

  * `plan != free`
  * valid email
  * email notifications enabled (default = on)

---

### Data Used (reuse Owner View logic)

Compute weekly metrics:

* Revenue last week
* Jobs completed last week
* New leads last week
* Outstanding invoices (count + total)
* Upcoming jobs (next 7 days)

No new tables required.

---

### Email Content (plain, clear, mobile-friendly)

**Subject**

> “Your GigAid weekly summary”

**Body**

* Header: “Here’s how your business did last week”
* Sections:

  * 💰 Revenue
  * 🛠 Jobs completed
  * 📥 New leads
  * ⚠️ Unpaid invoices
  * 📅 Jobs coming up

**CTA**

* “View full Owner Summary”
* Link to `/owner`

No images required. Simple HTML or text is fine.

---

## 3️⃣ Technical Constraints (important)

* Do NOT block existing email flows
* Do NOT introduce real-time analytics
* Do NOT send emails to free users
* Fail silently if data is missing (no crashes)
* Log sends for debugging

---

## 4️⃣ Explicit Non-Goals (do NOT implement)

* ❌ Daily emails
* ❌ Custom schedules
* ❌ Per-metric configuration
* ❌ Billing management
* ❌ Email marketing templates

---

## 5️⃣ Success Criteria

* Free users see Owner View → understand value → upgrade
* Paid users:

  * Access Owner View freely
  * Receive weekly summaries
  * Click through at least occasionally
* No impact to:

  * mobile job flows
  * lead capture
  * scheduling
  * invoicing

---

**Proceed with implementation exactly within this scope.**

---

## Strategic note (for you, not the code)

This does two critical things:

* **Justifies paid plans** without feature bloat
* **Builds habit** via weekly “money check-ins”

If you want next, I can:

* Design the **exact upgrade copy**
* Recommend **pricing tiers tied to this**
* Add a **monthly summary for higher plans**
* Or wire this into **SendGrid with sample code**

Just tell me the next move.
