Here’s a **clean, copy-paste ready Replit prompt** that’s explicit enough to get this implemented correctly **without breaking your existing booking flow**, while still leaving room for Replit to choose sane libraries.

### ✅ Replit Prompt: Google Maps Address Autocomplete on Booking Page

> **Goal**
> Enhance the public Booking Page so that when a user starts typing their local address, Google Maps Places Autocomplete is used to suggest addresses and automatically populate **Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code** fields.

---

### 📌 Functional Requirements

1. **Address Autocomplete Input**

   * Replace the current free-text “Address” input on the Booking Page with a Google Maps Places Autocomplete–enabled input.
   * As the user types, show a dropdown list of suggested addresses from Google Maps.
   * Restrict suggestions to **physical addresses only** (no businesses or PO boxes).

2. **Auto-Populate Address Fields**

   * When a user selects an address suggestion, automatically populate:

     * `street_address`
     * `city`
     * `state`
     * `zip_code`
   * Store these values in the existing booking form state and submission payload.

3. **Manual Fallback**

   * If Google Maps fails to load or autocomplete is unavailable:

     * Allow users to manually enter address, city, state, and zip code.
     * Do not block booking submission.

4. **Validation**

   * Ensure `zip_code` is valid for the selected country (default to U.S.).
   * Prevent form submission if required address fields are missing.

---

### 🔐 Technical Constraints & Safety

* Use **Google Maps Places API (Autocomplete)**.
* Store the API key securely using **Replit Secrets** (`GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`).
* Lazy-load the Google Maps script only on the Booking Page.
* Do **not** refactor unrelated booking logic.
* Do **not** break existing bookings, reminders, or payment flows.
* Keep the implementation modular and reversible.

---

### 🧩 UI / UX Expectations

* Show a subtle “Powered by Google” label as required by Google Maps TOS.
* Maintain the current visual design of the Booking Page.
* Keyboard navigation must work for address suggestions.
* Mobile-friendly behavior is required.

---

### 🧠 Implementation Guidance (Not Hard Requirements)

* Use Google Places `address_components` to extract:

  * street number + route → street address
  * locality → city
  * administrative_area_level_1 → state
  * postal_code → zip
* Prefer a lightweight wrapper (e.g., `@react-google-maps/api`) if React is used.
* Ensure cleanup of event listeners on component unmount.

---

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

* Typing an address shows Google suggestions.
* Selecting an address auto-fills street, city, state, and zip.
* Form submits successfully with populated values.
* Manual entry works if autocomplete is unavailable.
* No regression in existing booking functionality.

---

If you want, next I can:

* Add **distance-based slot optimization** using the zip code
* Restrict bookings by **service area radius**
* Or chain this into **travel-time-aware scheduling**

Just say which one.
