🎯 Real scenario: Facebook Marketplace job → Paid Gig (with GigAid)
The situation

User: Mike
Trade: Handyman
Source: Facebook Marketplace
Job: “Need a TV mounted today — cash or Zelle”

Mike is scrolling Facebook on his phone. He wants the job.

⏱️ T = 0 minutes — The moment GigAid earns its keep

Mike taps the post.

He needs to respond fast — speed matters more than polish.

❌ Without GigAid

Types a rushed message

Forgets to ask key questions

No record if customer ghosts

Pricing disputes later

✅ With GigAid (this is the key)

Mike taps Share → GigAid (or copy/paste).

GigAid pops up a Quick Reply Composer.

✉️ GigAid’s assist (quiet, helpful, not AI-flashy)

GigAid shows Mike a suggested reply, editable in 2 seconds:

“Hi! I can help with that.
Are you mounting one TV?
And what size is it?”

Mike hits Send in Facebook Messenger.

GigAid simultaneously:

Creates a Lead

Tags source = Facebook

Service = TV Mounting

Status = New

Mike didn’t “enter data”.
It just happened.

⏱️ T = +5 minutes — The negotiation (where deals are won)

Customer replies:

“One TV, 65 inch. How much?”

Mike taps Reply with GigAid again.

GigAid suggests:

“For a 65″ TV, I charge $120 and can come today or tomorrow.
Does that work for you?”

Mike tweaks it to $130 and sends.

⏱️ T = +6 minutes — Price agreement (this is the moment of truth)

Customer replies:

“That works. Today if possible.”

THIS is where GigAid becomes the system of record

Mike taps “Confirm Price” in GigAid.

GigAid generates a Price Confirmation link and auto-sends:

“Perfect. Here’s a quick confirmation so we’re aligned on price and time.”

Customer taps the link and hits:
✅ “Looks good”

Now:

Price is locked

Timestamped

Zero ambiguity

⏱️ T = +7 minutes — Deposit (optional but powerful)

GigAid prompts Mike:

“Hold this appointment with a deposit?”

Mike selects:

$30 “Hold your spot” deposit

Customer sees:

“This holds your appointment and is applied to the final price.”

Customer pays via Apple Pay.

Now the job is real.

⏱️ T = +8 minutes — Job auto-created

GigAid automatically:

Converts Lead → Job

Sets date/time

Marks deposit received

Enables reminders

Shows balance due: $100

Mike didn’t build anything.
No admin.
No forms.

⏱️ T = +2 hours — Reminder saves the day

GigAid sends customer:

“Mike is on the way.”

Customer replies:

“Thanks, see you soon.”

No no-show. No anxiety.

⏱️ T = Job complete — Payment without awkwardness

Mike taps Complete Job.

GigAid sends invoice:

Total: $130

Deposit applied: –$30

Balance due: $100

Customer pays on phone.

⏱️ T = +1 minute — Review loop (future work engine)

GigAid sends:

“How did Mike do?”

5-star review lands.

Mike responds with one tap.

🌙 That evening — Owner View (this is retention)

Mike opens GigAid on desktop.

He sees:

$130 earned today

1 job completed

0 unpaid invoices

Next job tomorrow

GigAid didn’t feel like software.
It felt like control.
